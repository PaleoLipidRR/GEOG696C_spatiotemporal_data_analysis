    "## Generating random numbers in Numpy\n",

    "Numpy has extensive functions for generating random numbers or permutations of numbers for our use.  [Real Python has a useful description here](https://realpython.com/numpy-random-number-generator/) as well as a description of the challenges and mechanics of generating random numbers (both more important and less trivial than you might imagine!). For the Numpy user manual, you can start [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/index.html). Numpy actually [now recommends](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/index.html) a two-step process -- first, calling the [Generator](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generator.html#numpy.random.default_rng) e.g. `rng = np.random.default_rng()` and then using `rng` (the output of the Generator) to call the specific distributions you might want to use.  In what follows below, I use the (apparently) outdated approach of calling `random` directly from Numpy. "

As Numpy [says](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/index.html):\n",
    "> 'Our RNGs are deterministic sequences and can be reproduced by specifying a seed integer to derive its initial state. By default, with no seed provided, default_rng will create seed the RNG from nondeterministic data from the operating system and therefore generate different numbers each time. The pseudo-random sequences will be independent for all practical purposes, at least those purposes for which our pseudo-randomness was good for in the first place.'\n"
